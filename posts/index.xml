      <description>This blog has gotten a new look, recently. For the last ~5 years this blog has been build with Jekyll, now it has been migrated to Hugo. With this migration I implemented a few changes, that were longer in the making.
Articles as stand-alone HTML pages Anticipating future migrations of the content, we treat posts as documents that should be as stand-alone as possible. This means:
  No header/footer content, just a link to the Home at the top.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crash events are some of the more serious events that can happen when operating a service.  Usually
it is crashing components that cause cascading failures and service outages.  It is critical to have
good visibility into those events, since they can cause major damage and should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
