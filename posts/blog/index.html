				<p>This blog has gotten a new look, recently.
For the last ~5 years this blog has been build with Jekyll, now it has been migrated to Hugo.
With this migration I implemented a few changes, that were longer in the making.</p>
<h2 id="articles-as-stand-alone-html-pages">Articles as stand-alone HTML pages</h2>
<p>Anticipating future migrations of the content, we treat posts as documents that should be as stand-alone as possible.
This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No header/footer content, just a link to the Home at the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded CSS/JS, at least for exported versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded images (base64) when possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loose-coupling---no-hirarchies">Loose Coupling - No hirarchies</h2>
<p>The index is just a large index.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-as-publishing-tool">Hugo as Publishing tool</h2>
<p>When articles are reduced to single pages, the site generator loses much of it&rsquo;s importance and
becomes a publishing/export tool.</p>
<p>Hugo has a bug advantage over jekyll of instant reloads in the browser.</p>
<p>With jekyll I had to wait ~10 seconds until I got an updated web view on my text.
With hugo this is instant the second I save the text.</p>
<p>Optimizing the editing loop and the publication pipeline are essential for writing productivity.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-content-generators">Alternative Content Generators</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Latex</strong>
For mathematical text, there is just nothing that beats latex at this point.  It&rsquo;s mainly the macro
system, that allows to build commands for the concepts you introduce that is hard to migrate to
markdown.  Also printing needs to be a first-class citizen, as papers are consumed in print.  Latex
fit&rsquo;s the bill very well. I intend to produce mathematical writings as pdf and either link them for
download from the index page, or embed them as iframe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jupyter</strong> Jupyter notebooks can be exported to HTML in various ways.  My setup here is not
polished, but I have had workflows in the past, where I could write articles and illustrations
directly from Jupyter.  Marking cells/output as hidden is the most cumbersome bit here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>org-mode</strong> In have not used org-mode much recently, but integrating posts from org-mode in
various output forms, e.g. html, pdf, text, should be rather stragith forward.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugo allows posts to be published from a folder not a file.  So it&rsquo;s possible to aggregate all the
supporting material in a folder, before producing the results.</p>
<h2 id="github-markdown-theme">GitHub Markdown Theme</h2>
<p>When it comes to aestetics the GitHub Flavored Markdown is hard to beat.
Simple style that get&rsquo;s the job done, that is already familiar to the technical readers.
Embedded code and syntax highlighting work well, and are polished in general:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c1"># python</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;hello world!&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="c1">;; lisp</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">message</span> <span class="s">&#34;hello world&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span class="cp"># C
</span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span><span class="cp"></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
