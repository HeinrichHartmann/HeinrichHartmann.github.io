<h1>Elements</h1>
</center>

This manuscript contains mathematical expositions of concepts that are relevant
to my work. As a trained mathematician, I always fell the strong need to have a
formal description of the concepts I work with at hand. Often-times these formal
descriptions are in-feasible beacuse of the complexity involved. On some
occasions, formal descriptions are available, or possible to derive.

This is the place where I collect those formalizations and make them available
as theoretical "element" for anyone to look at.
