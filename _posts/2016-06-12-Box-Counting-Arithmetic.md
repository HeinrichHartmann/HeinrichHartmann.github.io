I was recently invited to a wedding of a friend, where I had the
pleasure to meet the the 4-year old Benjamin[^1] who was fascinated by
numbers and arithmetic. Sharing and often repeating the
[laments of Paul Lockhardt](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf),
I was eager to show him some aspects of mathematics, that are fun to
explore and not commonly taught in schools.

Given his young age and tiny size he had already mastered a fair
amount of arithmetic. His favorite topic where gigantic numbers. He
had a 30page(!) list of large numbers with their names (Billion,
Trillion, etc.) with him and he had a burning question for me at the
very beginning:

> "What is the largest number that has a name?"

The largest number in his book was the GoogolPlex ($10^{Googol}$), but
he suspected that there are even larger numbers which have a
name. While that question is a little deeper than I was comfortable
going into at that point
(cf. [Interesting Number Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox)),
we settled for the moment, by creating another number which was even
larger than the GoogolPlex:

$$ GoogolPlex \cdot 1000 \cdot 100 + 27 + 4 + 100 \cdot 1000000 $$

I suggested to name the number Rachel[^1] in honor of his mother, but
Benjamin replied: "This is not a good name for a number".  So we went
with "GoogolPlexilliardenSeptillion" and appended it to his
list.

While gigantically large numbers fascinated him clearly most, he also
had a considerable fun at solving arithmetic puzzles ($$5x7, 9x12$$), and
so I told him the following box counting game.

## Numbers and Boxes

Many arithmetic questions can be conveniently translated into geometry using
the following rules:

- We represent number $n$ as set of $n$ boxes. The size and color of boxes do not matter.
- Box sets can be added by merging them.
- Box sets can be multiplied by counting boxes in rectangles.

Now what can we do with this almost trivial translation of numbers into boxes?

The main observation is, that now

> Every multiplication becomes a problem of counting boxes in a rectangle!

## Warmup: What is 7x5?

Presented as a box counting problem, we ask how many boxes there are
in a 5x7 rectangle!

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7x5grid.png)

There are many ways to count the boxes, e.g. by crossing one off after another:

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7x5random.png)

But we might also apply some systematic, like this one:

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7x5-A.png)

or this one:

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7x5-d.png)

Most people would approaching this problem by reciting the succession
of multiples of seven: 7,14,21,28,35. In terms of box counting this
corresponds to this pattern here:

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7-14-21.png)

In fact, this is more a decomposition of the rectangle in multiple
lines, as a simple counting pattern. And it reveals a very powerful
technique for counting box arrangements:

**Divide and Conquer:** Chop the rectangle into smaller rectangles,
that are easier to count.

If you approach $7\times 5$ as a decomposition problem, the following
decomposition seems more natural and yields a quite convenient way to
calculate $7\times 5$ as:

$$ 7\times 5 = 5 \times 5 + 2 \times 5 = 25 + 10 = 35.$$

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7x5-5x5.png)

Here is another variant: If you rearrange the 5x7-rectangle as follows you
get the identity

$$5\times 7=6\times 6-1=36-1.$$

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/7x5-6x6.png)

That was neat, wasn't it?

## What is 11x11?

Let's do another example: What is 11x11.

I asked Benjamin to calculate this number, and he proceeded, as
expected, by the standard method of reciting the 11 succession.  It
was quite impressive to see him handling these calculations at
pre-school age and arrive at the correct answer: 121.

However, I had just asked him, 10x10, which he knew by heart: 100!

So essentially, he had just counted all boxes in a 10x10 square.  And
posed with the problem of counting all boxes in an 11x11 square, which
is just 1 box larger, he started from scratch and recited his series.
Poor boy!

Here is how you do better:

$$11\times 11 = 10\times 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 121$$

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/11x11.png)

## A Square Number Theorem

Those simple observations already open up more questions about the
large and fascinating topic of square numbers.

The above trick to calculate 11x11 generalizes to the following theorem.

**Theorem.** The number of boxes in a square of size $N+1$ is equal to
the number of boxes in a square of size $N$, plus $2N$ (at the sides)
plus 1 (at the tip).

It's not possible to provide a formal proof using the explicit box
counting methods introduced above. We either need more profound set
theory and induction, or formal arithmetic $(N+1)^2 = N^2 +2N + 1$,
which derives this in a breeze. However, there is value in
illustrations. Benjamin followed that argument quickly, while working
with parameters $N,x$ and the binomial theorem would have been too
much and/or boring for him. And frankly, most schools don't bother to
present proofs at all and stay at the phenomenological level.

Ok, here is another exercise:

## What is 13x13?

If you followed through to here, you will directly say:

$$ 13\times 13 = 12\times 12 + 2\times 12 + 1 = 12\times 12 + 25$$

But you might not remember what $12 \times 12$ is. Do you?

So, let's calculate that first. So what is 12x12?

"I know!", you will now say, "We can apply that same trick again!". And indeed:

$$ 12\times 12 = 11\times 11 + 2\times 11 + 1 = 11\times 11 + 23$$

Fortunately we have already calculated $11\times 11 = 100 + 21$ so that we can substitute.

$$13\times 13 = 100 + 21 + 23 + 25$$

Which I'll leave for you as an exercise from here.

From the perspective of counting boxes, we have just performed the
following construction:

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/13x13.png)

Ha, that's interesting. We decompose a square into layers of square-angles!

But we don't have to stop at 10x10. We can go all the way down to 1x1!

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/13x13rainbow.png)

But wait, there is another pattern: The size of those square angles are just the odd numbers!

**Theorem.** The number of boxes in a square of size $N$ is equal to the
sum of all odd numbers smaller than $2N$.

## Sums of even numbers.

We have just discovered that the sum of odd numbers are squares. This raises the next
interesting question immediately:

> What are the sums of even numbers: $2 + 4 + ... + 2n$ ?

There is a cheap trick, how you can get from all odd numbers to all even
numbers: You can subtract one!

There is a special box, in each square-angle which seems predestinated
for being tossed: The diagonal box:

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/13x13-D.png)

Looking at this picture, we can see, that The sum of even numbers up to 24, is equal to the
full square of size 13 minus the diagonal with 13 elements:

  $$2+4+\dots+24 = 13\times 13 - 13.$$

Generalizing, we find another pattern:

**Theorem.** The number sum of all even numbers smaller or equal to than $2n$ is $(n+1)^2 - (n+1)$

We are not at the end. There is another trick that can be applied.

By removing the diagonal the box count just got symmetric! There are
as many boxes on the top as there are on the left side: In other words
we can extract a factor of $2$:

  $$2 + 4 + ... + 2n = 2 \times (1 + 2 + ... + n)$$

![](/assets/BoxCounting_files/13x13-half.png)

Combining both tricks, we have just found another derivation of the [Little Gauss' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_â‹¯):


**Theorem (Little Gauss).** The sum of all number smaller or equal to $n$ is

  $$ \frac{(n+1)^2 - (n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}. $$

## Going further

We are clearly just at the beginning here. Framing arithmetic problems
as box counting problems allows creative approaches and raises many
interesting questions: Can you find the identity hidden in the picture
at the very top?
