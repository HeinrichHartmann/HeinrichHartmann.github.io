- Audience: Software Engineers, General Public
- Goal: Share take-away from struggling to write since 15 years 

## Introduction

- Writing is key for career development in SWE. The more senior you get the more
  important it get's to scale yourself out and have impact on the wider
  organization. Wirting technical documents/narratives is the key to getting
  your voice heraed and explainig your ideas to a large audience.

- Many Software engineers struggle with writing. Personally I never had an
  intrinsic interest in literature or writing. Also I spent days and weeks
  agonizing and procrasinating around larger writing tasks.

- Here are some take-aways that helped me to produce [some](/#post) half-way
  decent pieces of writing over the past 15 years. I am sharing them in the
  hope, that you find them useful.

## Before you begin

### Have Something to Say

- Surprisingly often a problem.
- Example: I was tasked with writing long Word documents for EU projects. This
  was terrible experience, becuase the main goal was to look good and fill
  pages.
- Goal of your writing is to deliver a message to an audience as effective as
  possible. If it can be short, this is an advantage.

- If you don't have the message clear in your head, your are not ready to write yet.
  You have other things to do first: Reasech, Analysis or Exploration.
  This is a much harder task.

### Know your audience

- Make it concrete: Whom are you telling this to?
- What prior assumptions does your audience have? Where do you need to start?

### Be aware of your current brain context

### Respect your state-of-mind

- There is no way you will get anything done when you are tired
- Prepare for a grind
- Ideally you want to get into a flow space, where you are very focused and
  productive for a very long period of time.
- Block at least 2h of time
- Avoid distractions if you can

## When you start

### Start from the Top not the Beginning

### How to write an Abstract?

* Abstract comes last
* Abstract summarizes content. Some duplicaton is needed. Typically outlines
  the main results, but does not give everything away.
* In IT literature it is standard to also write a conclusion. Assumes that the
  reader have read the material, and makes back-references to the sections.

### How to choose a title?

* Title needs to compromise between being bold/engaging and being correct 

## The practice of writing 

### Exercise writing

- Use issue tickets, and emails as exerecises 

### Estabish a feedback loop

- Get a mentor
