## Introduction

Inspiration for this talk comes from Gil Tene - How (NOT) to Measure Latency?

I have been talking about Statistics and Lantency for the last years:  
[State of the Histogram (SLOConf 2021)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-5PNlv8eK0)
  / [Circllhist (paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06561)

  / [Statistics for Enginees (2014..2019)](https://github.com/HeinrichHartmann/Statistics-for-Engineers/)
  

In this talk/blog I am collecting my learnings, and bring them into a fresh form.
