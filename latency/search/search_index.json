Instrumenting Code A Latency Measurement Measuring Latency in code is relatively straight forward: t_start = time . now () # # code section you want to measure # latency = time . now () - t_start Things to watch out for: Capture early returns / exceptions. Use: defer , try/catch/finally . Which clock is used? What Resolution? sec / ms / usec / ns Monotonic or affected by NTP resets? What is measured? System Time, Process Time Want: high resolution, monotonic, system time: Java System.nanoTime() C clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,...) / gethrtime Python time.monotonic() Measurement Overhead. Checking the time costs time. Depending on implementation this can be 30ns - 300ns for the C-level call, plus function call overhead of the language runtime. (cf. [TS2016]) Rule of thumb: OK to measure latencies of 0.1ms or larger. If you are taking more than three time measurements, it's likely a good idea to abstract the time measurement into an object or a decorator, that can be used as follows: @timed def do_some_things (): ... Some tracing libraries (e.g. OpenTelemetry ) provide such decorators out-of-the box. Measuring Latency over Time Associating Latency Measurements with Reporting Windows When measuring latency over time, e.g. in a monitoring system, there are trickly interactions of the collection window with the request duration that we are capturing: Do we count processes that overlap the collection windows? Best Practices: Count requests to the collection window when they were completed When shutting down the benchmark, wait for all requests to complete! Keep an eye on the active requests (metric) Capture max latency, if this is larger than collection window, we make serious mistakes. Option: count active requests with the elapsed duration at end-of-window. Where to Measure Latency? +--------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +--------+ | Client | -----> | Intermedy | > | Intermedy | ------> | Server | +--------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +--------+ This is the much trickier part! We are most interested in measuring timings of request-reply interactions in potentially distributed system (HTTP/gRPC API calls). The latency that the client experiences is influenced by the whole chain of interactions. Tradeoff: Measuring close to client is more meaningful but hard Measuring at server is easy but can be extermely misleading Best: Measure Both -> Tracing. Hidden Queues The computer systems we are working with have a lot of hidden queues in the HTTP libraries, TCP/IP stack, NIC Cards, Network Gear, etc. this means that the latency that the client experiences may be much worse, than what can be measured on the server side. It's very hard to observe those queues directly, we have to measure at the client to make sure we capture the impacts of all of them. Response Time vs. Service Time Response Time vs. Service Time Spans It's very easy to confuse response time with service time. If you are measing latency at the server, you are measuring service time. Serice time behaves like response time when there is little traffic Service time can look completely fine even if your clients have bad experience. The consequences of confusing service time with response time are quite drastic. Let's do some analysis... Coordinated Omission In benchmarking applications there are are a surprising number of cases, where the load generator coordinates with the system under test, and thereby skews latency measurements. We call this phenomenon Coordinated Ommission . Examples: Load is generated in loop like so: while True : start = time . now () request . get ( \"some.api/endpoint\" ) record ( time . now () - start ) This logic backs-up as soon as the requests take longer. You are effectively measuring service-time of a single worker. When latency is dominated by GC activity (e.g. Java) and the load generator runs in the in the same process, it will be affected by GC pauses as well, and hence miss requests when the system is stalled. Comment: Gil Tenes original definition is more broad, and captures all cases where one may confuse Repsonse time with Service time. IMHO, this definition is overly broad, and can be distilled into more concise bits, like we do here.
