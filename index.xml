      <description>Crash events are one of the more serious events that can happen when operating a service. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s crashing components that cause cascading failures and service outages. It&amp;rsquo;s critical to have good visibility into those events, since they can cause major damage and should be avoided.
Unfortunately, debugging crashes is one of the more complicated endeavors. The state of a crash process is often compromised and the process can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted to collect debugging information on it&amp;rsquo;s own.</description>
