      <description>nix is a package manager that does things a little differently. I have fascinated by nix ever since Christine Koppelt told me about it a few years back when we were working together in Munich.
The basic idea behind nix, is that all sofware is kept in a content addressable* store, and only the exact dependencies needed are made available in a build, dev or runtime environment. The design has some similarity with git and aims to solve similar problems as docker.</description>
