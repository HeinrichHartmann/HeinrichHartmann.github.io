      <description>In this post, I will walk you through the Observability setup I am using form my home-lab. The full infrastructure setup is explained in this blog post, and available on GitHub. In this post, we will zone-in on the Observability configuration and tooling, which is contained in this folder.
We will conduct this exercise top-down, and focus on the key questions that we want to answer about our services in the order of importance, and briefly comment on the implementation details and open-ends.</description>

      <description>I have recently published the full configuration of my home-lab infrastructure on GitHub:
https://github.com/HeinrichHartmann/svc
In this post, I will give you a brief overview about the setup.
Design Goals:
Quick on-boarding of containerized services. Family members can use the services on any of their devices. No fiddling with IPs and Port names. Services have their own DNS names. Stored data is backed-up safely. Solution Summary:
Services are on-boarded by creating a directory with a docker-compose.</description>
